# data-exploration-project
In this project, I explored a dataset of housing information using various data analysis techniques.

Link to data source: https://github.com/rashida048/Datasets/blob/master/home_data.csv

Libraries used: csv, pandas, pandas profiling, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

**Summary Statistics:**
The summary statistics script calculates basic statistics about the data, including count, mean, min/max, standard deviation, and quartiles.

**Univariate Analysis:**
This script shows the distribution of price data for homes and answers the question 'Is the price data skewed?'. The answer is yes - the data is skewed to the right, meaning people disproportionately buy lower-priced houses compared to expensive ones.
